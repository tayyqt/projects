# Repository of Past Projects  
This contains past projects I have worked on which are available for public viewing.

## Brazilian eCommerce Olist
As part of a final project, I analysed an available ecommerce dataset in order to explore how data visualization can be constructed for an ecommerce client.

## LinkedIn Scraper for Topic Analysis
For another project, I modified an existing scraper to pull the top 1000 LinkedIn posts off a job search. This was to be fed into SAS Enterprise Miner for topic / sentiment analysis.
